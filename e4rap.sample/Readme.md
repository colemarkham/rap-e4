e4rap.sample
======

This is a very basic E4 sample application which was created using the E4 Tooling. The file open handler was modified to remove the reference to FileDialog. It should be possible to add the FileDialog from the RAP Incubator. This application should run as-is on E4 SWT as well, just change the target-platform accordingly.
